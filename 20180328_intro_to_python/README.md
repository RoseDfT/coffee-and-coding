# Python for Analysts Training

## Introduction

Hi! And welcome to my Python for Analysts training course!

## Structure

I've split up the original repo (which was a wall of Jupyter Notebooks) into separate folders as follows:

1. basics
2. data_analysis
3. data_viz
4. machine_learning
5. other

Presently the **5. other** folder contains a mixture of stuff that will be refactored into new sections of the training as I go. For a detailed breakdown of what's included in each of the folders, check out the individual README.md files (most of which aren't written yet!)


## Credits

Massive thanks to Tom Ewing for the first draft of this training.
