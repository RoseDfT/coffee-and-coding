# Coffee & Coding
### _14/02/2019_

A _public_ repository to hold resources and notes from Coffee & Coding sessions.

Get in touch at: coffee.coding@dft.gov.uk

### Contributing 
Note that resources are _publicly accessible_. When adding new content work on a branch and submit a pull request. 

Folders should adhere to the following conventions:

* `YYYYMMDD_Topic_Name`
* All folders should contain a `README.md` with notes or a brief explanation

### Aim
The aim of the Coffee & Coding meetups is to nurture, enable and encourage a vibrant, supportive and inclusive coding community at DfT. Coffee & Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within DfT who are interested in coding to share skills and knowledge, provide advice and guidance to each other and generally network and get to know each other. The format is generally 40 minutes for a presentation and questions to the presenter/s followed by 20 minutes Code Surgery. The presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using these methods. From time to time we will invite external speakers. The Code Surgery provides the opportunity for people to pose any coding related queries/ruminations/ideas to the gathered coding community.

| Thu 21 Feb 2019 | 11:00 | H4      | One-sided matching of two sets based on preferences | [Avision Ho](https://github.com/avisionh) | Consider that you have a set of people going to a conference and a set of talks taking place simultaneously. Each person cannot go to more than one talk but they have preferences over which talk they want to attend. How do you efficiently match people to talks based on their preferences? Based on a true story. This talk will describe how the problem was tackled and briefly outline the ongoing project in making it useful for wider business by turning it into an R Shiny app using a range of free, open-source collaborative data science and project management tools. Talk is available on GitHub pages [here](https://avisionh.github.io/Preference-Allocation/#1) and work-in-progress Shiny app is available [here](https://avisionh.shinyapps.io/preference20allocation/). To see the live development of the Shiny app alongside the code, please access the public Azure DevOps project [here](https://avisionh.visualstudio.com/Preference%20Allocation) |
